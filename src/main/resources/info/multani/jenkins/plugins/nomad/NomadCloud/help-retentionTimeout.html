Time in minutes after which the Nomad cloud plugin will clean up an idle
worker that has not already terminated. This cleanup is only necessary in
exceptional conditions; typically workers will terminate upon completion of the
invoking task.

<p>For tasks that use very large images, this timeout can be increased to avoid
early termination of the task while the Nomad job is still deploying.</p>
